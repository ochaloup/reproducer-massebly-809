= Reproducer of MASSEMBLY-809

Assembly plugin requires precise dependency order when classifier is used.

See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MASSEMBLY-809

== HOW TO

* `mvn install`
* `unzip -l assembly/target/project-assembly-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-assembly-test-for-project-doc.zip`

== WHAT IS HERE

Folder `project` contains a `pom.xml` which generates a project jar file which contains a `java class` file.

Then `maven-jar-plugin` is configured to create a additional jar file containing documentation represented
by html file generated from Asciidoctor file (adoc) just before by asciidoctor maven plugin.

Folder `assembly` then contains `pom.xml` which configures assembly plugin to create a `.zip` file which will
contain both jar files created from `project`. It means a project jar file and project doc jar file.
